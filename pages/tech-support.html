      <h2>How We Help You Build a Career in IT</h2>
      <p>
        At FlexPoint Services, our primary focus is IT training and career preparation. We work with individuals who want to enter the tech field,
        advance their current skills, or transition into higher-paying IT roles — even if they have no prior background in technology.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We start with a free consultation to understand your experience, goals, and timeline. Based on that, we guide you toward the most effective
        learning path — whether that means certification preparation, foundational IT skills, or advanced technical training. Our goal is not just to
        help you pass an exam, but to help you become confident, capable, and job-ready.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Our training approach goes beyond certifications. We emphasize practical knowledge, real-world scenarios, and career readiness. That includes
        structured learning plans, hands-on guidance, resume support, and interview preparation so you are prepared for both the certification and the job market.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In addition to training, we provide professional IT consulting and technical support for individuals and small businesses. This allows our students
        and clients to gain exposure to real IT environments while receiving reliable support for systems, networks, and everyday technical needs.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Whether you are starting from scratch or already working in IT, FlexPoint Services offers affordable, flexible training and consulting designed
        to help you move forward with confidence — without unnecessary costs or unrealistic promises.
