      <h2>How We Help with Retirement & Financial Planning</h2>
      <p>
        At FlexPoint Services, we provide personalized retirement planning and financial strategy support to help you prepare for a secure and stress-free future. 
        Our services are ideal for individuals at any stage of their career—from those just getting started to those nearing retirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We assist clients in setting up tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as <strong>Roth IRAs</strong>, and we review employer-sponsored plans like <strong>401(k)</strong> to ensure you’re maximizing company match contributions and benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our approach includes reviewing your current financial health, identifying opportunities for growth, and advising on how to optimize your retirement savings.
        We also consult with clients on whether they are fully utilizing all retirement resources offered through their employer.
