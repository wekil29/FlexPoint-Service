      <h2>How We Help with Your Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        At FlexPoint Services, we take the stress out of tax season by offering expert tax preparation for both individuals and small businesses. 
        Our approach is flexible and client-centered — whether you're a salaried employee, gig worker, freelancer, or a small business owner, we’ll ensure your taxes are filed accurately and on time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll review your documents, uncover every possible deduction, and help you minimize your liability. If you're self-employed or operate a business, we handle quarterly filings, Schedule C, and more. We also assist with prior-year corrections, ITIN renewals, and IRS correspondence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy in-person appointments, remote support, and extended hours including weekends. We’re here to make sure you file confidently.
